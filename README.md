# Umer Iqbal - Full-Stack Web Developer Portfolio

## 🚀 About Me

Hi, I'm **Umer Iqbal**, a final-year Computer Science student at **Pak-AIMS**, passionate about crafting exceptional web experiences. I learned web development through dedication, problem-solving, and building 20+ projects from scratch.

After exploring software development and network engineering, I realized **web development was my true calling**. I've spent the last three years mastering the craft and building SaaS solutions that deliver real value.

My development philosophy centers on **minimal, user-friendly design with clean aesthetics and lightning-fast experiences**. I believe great software isn't just about features—it's about how seamlessly those features enhance user productivity.

**Currently seeking opportunities** to gain 1-2 years of professional experience before combining full-time work with freelancing. I'm open to remote opportunities worldwide and available for on-site roles in **Lahore, Pakistan**.
